Project: Crypto Market Data Collector
Purpose: Automated collection of cryptocurrency market data for future ML/analysis use

Current Status:
1. Basic Infrastructure ✅
- PostgreSQL database setup with proper schema
- Core data collection services
- Error handling and logging
- Runs as a continuous service

1. Data Collection Features ✅
- Real-time price ticks (1-minute intervals)
- OHLCV data (candlesticks) at multiple timeframes (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d)
- Metadata from CoinGecko (updated every 5 minutes)
- Currently tracking: BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL

1. Technical Components:
```
CryptoAPIs/
├── src/
│   ├── database.py    - Database operations, schema management
│   ├── collector.py   - Data collection logic (Binance & CoinGecko)
│   └── config.py      - Configuration settings
├── schema.sql         - Database structure
└── main.py           - Service entry point
```

Next Steps Needed:
1. Data Validation & Quality
   - Add data quality checks
   - Implement data validation before storage
   - Add monitoring for missing data

2. Service Reliability
   - Add automatic recovery from failures
   - Implement proper backup system
   - Add system health monitoring

3. Data Analysis Tools
   - Create query interfaces for the collected data
   - Add basic analysis capabilities
   - Implement data export functionality

4. Future Enhancements
   - Add more trading pairs
   - Include additional data sources
   - Implement data aggregation methods

The system is currently functional for basic data collection but needs additional work on reliability and data quality before being production-ready for ML model training.
